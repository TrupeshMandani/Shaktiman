# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Food Ordering Application

## Context

We are building a mobile application that enables users to place food orders with local restaurants. The application allows users to:
- Create accounts, save payment information, and see nearby restaurants
- Place orders for delivery or pickup
- Receive real-time order updates and status notifications
- Submit reviews and ratings for restaurants or food items
- View and reorder from order history

The application requires features such as location tracking, real-time updates, secure integrated payments, and menu synchronization.

## Decisions

### 1. Native vs. Hybrid App
**Decision:** Native app (Android and iOS)  
**Rationale:** Native provides optimal performance and direct access to device-specific features like GPS, notifications, and payment gateways. Given the need for real-time tracking and integrated payment, native ensures seamless performance.

### 2. UI Framework
**Decision:** React Native with Expo  
**Rationale:** React Native supports cross-platform apps with shared codebases. Expo offers tools for development acceleration, including push notifications and location tracking integration.

### 3. Backend Language
**Decision:** Node.js with Express  
**Rationale:** Node.js offers high-performance, non-blocking I/O, and Express allows for a scalable, API-focused backend to support real-time order updates and data processing.

### 4. Database and Data Storage
**Decision:** MongoDB with Mongoose  
**Rationale:** MongoDB’s NoSQL schema flexibility supports dynamic structures (e.g., user profiles, restaurant menus, orders), and Mongoose simplifies data modeling and querying.

### 5. Real-time Data and Order Tracking
**Decision:** Socket.io  
**Rationale:** Real-time, bidirectional communication is essential for real-time order updates and notifications.

### 6. Location Tracking
**Decision:** Google Maps API  
**Rationale:** Google Maps provides robust geolocation, ideal for showing nearby restaurants and tracking deliveries.

### 7. Push Notifications
**Decision:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)  
**Rationale:** FCM supports push notifications across Android and iOS, making it suitable for real-time updates and promotions.

### 8. Payment Gateway
**Decision:** Stripe and PayPal  
**Rationale:** Stripe and PayPal are secure, globally accepted payment options, offering flexibility and ease of integration.

### 9. Restaurant Menu Integration
**Decision:** REST API  
**Rationale:** A REST API allows seamless synchronization with restaurant inventory systems, keeping menus up-to-date.

### 10. Reviews and Ratings
**Decision:** In-app review system with moderation  
**Rationale:** A custom review system enables moderation and quality control, improving user trust and restaurant feedback.

### 11. Order History and Data Retrieval
**Decision:** MongoDB with query optimization  
**Rationale:** MongoDB supports flexible data storage and efficient retrieval for order history, allowing users to reorder quickly.

## Rationale for Decisions

### Native vs. Hybrid App
Native apps provide better performance and access to device-specific features, critical for real-time tracking, location-based recommendations, and secure payments. React Native with Expo offers a streamlined development process and access to essential APIs.

### Backend Language
Node.js and Express provide a lightweight, asynchronous backend that scales effectively with high concurrency, ideal for real-time applications handling large volumes of user data and transactions.

### Database and Data Storage
MongoDB's NoSQL flexibility handles various data types, including complex, nested structures like restaurant menus and user orders. Mongoose’s ODM layer facilitates data management and relationships.

### Real-time Data and Order Tracking
Socket.io supports real-time, bidirectional communication, essential for instant updates and notifications on order status.

### Payment Gateway
Stripe and PayPal offer secure, user-friendly payment options with global support, increasing accessibility for users.

### Restaurant Menu Integration
A REST API allows seamless, real-time updates from restaurant inventory systems, ensuring accurate menu data for users.

## Conclusion

The architecture decisions for this food ordering application prioritize performance, scalability, and a user-friendly experience. Technologies like React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, Stripe, and Google Maps API ensure the app’s ability to handle complex, real-time updates, secure transactions, and accurate location services.
